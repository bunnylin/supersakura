========================
It is November. The people of your village look forward to the winter.
Suddenly, a herald arrives!
He declares that it is time to pay your dues to King Rex I, the Artistic
Autocrat.
- "What dues?"
- "Why, you must pay for anything that makes you happy. Everything belongs to
  his majesty, but he is graciously allowing people to use his property for
  a fair reimbursement."
- "How can that be? I built my house. Why would it belong to the king?"
- "Because that is what kings are for. After all, someone must own
  everything. That is the only way to ensure that all things are ultimately
  used for the greatest benefit of everyone equally. So you see, although
  your house is really the king's, as long as you use the house fairly, you
  have license to reside there."

- "I didn't know we had a king."
- "He has a divine mandate. No one can argue with that."

- "So how much tax must we pay to this Artistic Autocrat?"
- "Tut! Speak not his majesty's name or title, for they are not yours. Only
  those specially favored by his majesty may utter them. For your
  presumption, your village must pay a name tax... in addition to the sun
  tax, air tax, earth tax, friendship tax, love tax, music tax, and the
  convenient tax collection tax. The total comes to two tenths of your food
  stores, but you will be pleased to know, that the next collection will
  likely be smaller."
- *outrage*
- "You will, of course, be exempt from the snow tax, as winter has been
  cancelled."
- "Cancelled!"
- "King Rex I discovered, through his wise advisors, that tax collection is
  brought to a halt during winter, since his tax collectors are unable to
  travel from village to village overseeing the people's use of his majesty's
  property. As a result, come spring, all villages had to pay additional tax
  with interest. Without winter, such undue breaks will no longer disrupt the
  safe and stable tax collection routine, benefiting everyone."

- "We cannot give away our food!"
- "Please remember, the food is not yours, but the king's. If you resist,
  your village will be punished with an additional tax of two hundred times
  your entire food stores. Surely, you see the reasonable option?"

- "Surely, the king will see that taxation like this will leave all villages
  starving. Soon, there will be no one left to pay taxes! If only someone
  would go and present our case to the king, he would change his taxes."
